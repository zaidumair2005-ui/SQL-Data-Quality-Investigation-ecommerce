> **Comprehensive data quality assessment of Brazilian e-commerce platform achieving 98% quality score with zero critical issues across 1.5M+ records.**

---

##  Project Overview

**Business Context:**  
E-commerce platforms depend on accurate data for revenue reporting, inventory management, and customer analytics. This analysis validates the Olist database's structural integrity to ensure it's production-ready for business intelligence and decision-making.

**Objective:**  
Systematically assess data quality across 8 interconnected tables using the industry-standard Six Dimensions framework (Completeness, Uniqueness, Consistency, Validity, Accuracy, Timeliness).

**Outcome:**  
✅ **Database approved for production use** — Zero critical issues, 100% referential integrity, ready for analytics without cleanup.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Database:** MySQL
- **SQL Client:** DBeaver
- **Analysis Techniques:** Aggregate functions, JOINs, subqueries, NULL detection, duplicate validation
- **Framework:** Six Dimensions of Data Quality

---

##  Analysis Methodology

### 1️⃣ **Completeness** (NULL Detection)
Checked all critical fields for missing values using `COUNT(*)` vs `COUNT(column)`.

### 2️⃣ **Uniqueness** (Duplicate Detection)  
Compared total rows vs `COUNT(DISTINCT key)` to identify duplicates.

### 3️⃣ **Consistency** (Referential Integrity)  
Validated 6 foreign key relationships using `LEFT JOIN` with orphan detection.

### 4️⃣ **Validity** (Business Rule Validation)  
Applied domain-specific logic (price ranges, date sequences, format compliance).

### 5️⃣ **Accuracy** (Outlier Detection)  
Investigated extreme values to distinguish errors from valid business behavior.

### 6️⃣ **Timeliness**  
Confirmed data coverage period (historical dataset, not real-time).

##  Key Findings

### ✅ **Overall Data Quality: Grade A (98/100)**

| Dimension | Score | Status | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Completeness** | 100% | ✓ PASS | All critical fields (IDs, prices, dates) populated |
| **Uniqueness** | 100% | ✓ PASS | No invalid duplicates detected |
| **Referential Integrity** | 100% | ✓ PASS | 0 orphaned records across 6 relationships |
| **Validity** | 100% | ✓ PASS | Prices valid, dates logical, business rules met |
| **Accuracy** | 98% | ✓ GOOD | 610 products (1.9%) missing categories |
| **Timeliness** | N/A | INFO | Historical dataset (2016-2018) |

---

###  **Completeness: 100% (PASS)**

**Zero NULL values in critical fields:**
- ✅ All customer IDs, order IDs, product IDs, seller IDs populated
- ✅ All transactional fields (prices, dates, payments) complete
- ✅ 100% completeness in operational tables

**Minor gaps (non-critical):**
- ⚠️ 610 products (1.9%) missing `product_category_name` — acceptable for new inventory
- ⚠️ 2 products (0.006%) missing `product_weight_g` — negligible impact

**Business Impact:**  
✓ No operational blockers. All fields required for order fulfillment, customer communication, and financial reporting are complete.

---

###  **Uniqueness: 100% (PASS)**

**No invalid duplicates detected:**

| Field | Unique Count | Total Records | Uniqueness |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| `customer_id` | 99,441 | 99,441 | 100% |
| `order_id` | 99,441 | 99,441 | 100% |
| `product_id` | 32,951 | 32,951 | 100% |
| `seller_id` | 3,095 | 3,095 | 100% |

**Important Business Distinction:**
- **Total customer records:** 99,441
- **Unique people (`customer_unique_id`):** 96,096
- **Difference:** 3,345 people (3.4%) have multiple `customer_id` entries

**Why This is VALID (Not an Error):**  
Olist assigns a new `customer_id` when a customer orders from a different delivery address.

**Example:**
- Customer moves from São Paulo → Rio de Janeiro
- Same person (`customer_unique_id = "ABC123"`) gets two `customer_id` entries (one per city)
- Preserves geolocation accuracy for delivery logistics

**Implication:**
- Use `customer_unique_id` for customer analytics (lifetime value, retention)
- Use `customer_id` for operations (delivery tracking, address validation)

**Repeated Order Items:**  
Multiple rows with the same `order_id` in `order_items` represent multi-item purchases (e.g., buying 3 books = 3 rows). This is **valid transactional data**, not duplication.

---

###  **Referential Integrity: 100% (PASS)**

**All foreign key relationships validated (6 critical paths):**

| Relationship | Child Table | Parent Table | Status | Orphaned | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Orders → Customers | orders (99,441) | customers | ✓ PASS | 0 | All orders traceable |
| Order Items → Orders | order_items (112,650) | orders | ✓ PASS | 0 | All items fulfill valid orders |
| Order Items → Products | order_items (112,650) | products | ✓ PASS | 0 | All items reference existing products |
| Order Items → Sellers | order_items (112,650) | sellers | ✓ PASS | 0 | All items link to valid sellers |
| Payments → Orders | order_payments (103,886) | orders | ✓ PASS | 0 | Financial integrity intact |
| Reviews → Orders | order_reviews (77,916) | orders | ✓ PASS | 0 | All feedback traceable |

**Zero orphaned records across 528,409 child→parent relationships.**

**Business Impact:**
- ✅ Revenue attribution 100% accurate (no payments without orders)
- ✅ Customer support can access complete order history
- ✅ Analytics joins work flawlessly (no broken links)
- ✅ All transactions traceable to customer, product, and seller

---

### **Validity: 100% (PASS)**

**Financial Integrity:**
- ✅ Zero invalid prices: All `price` and `freight_value` fields are ≥ 0
- ✅ Impact: Revenue and shipping cost calculations accurate

**Temporal Logic:**
- ✅ Zero chronological errors: All `order_delivered_customer_date` values occur AFTER `order_purchase_timestamp`
- ✅ Impact: Time-to-delivery KPIs are reliable

**Outlier Investigation:**
- 🔍 **Payment installments:** Maximum of 24 detected
- ✅ **Analysis:** Initially flagged, but confirmed as **standard Brazilian consumer credit practice**
- ✅ **Conclusion:** Valid business behavior, not a data error

**Order Status Distribution:**
| Status | Percentage | Assessment |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Delivered | 96.5% | ✅ Healthy |
| Shipped | 1.1% | ✅ Normal |
| Canceled | 0.6% | ✅ Low |
| Processing | 1.8% | ✅ Normal |
